The product covers only:
1. 🏗️ System Design & Architecture
2. ⚖️ Tradeoffs & Engineering Decisions
3. 📈 Scaling & Performance
4. 🔒 Reliability, Resilience, Failure Modes
No coding puzzles No framework trivia No behavioral fluff

6. Daily Interview Simulation Format (Critical)
Each day generates one static web page with the following non-negotiable structure:
1. Interview Context
* Realistic system scenario
* Scale, constraints, ambiguity
* Written in interviewer voice

2. Interview Question
* Open-ended
* Forces prioritization and judgment

3. ❌ Bad Answer (Weak Signal)
* Common but flawed response
* Shows shallow thinking
* Includes:
    * Why interviewers get concerned
    * What signal this sends

4. ✅ Good Answer (Senior Signal)
* Technically solid
* Reasonable tradeoffs
* Still incomplete
Includes:
* Why this passes senior bar
* Why it falls short for principal

5. ⭐ Best Answer (Principal Signal)
* Structured reasoning
* Explicit tradeoffs
* Scope control
* Long-term thinking
* Business + technical alignment
Includes:
* What interviewers listen for
* Why this de-risks the hire

6. Interviewer Evaluation Rubric
* Strong signals
* Red flags
* Follow-up probes interviewers might ask

7. Key Takeaways
* Reusable mental models
* Patterns applicable across interviews

7. Difficulty & Progression Model
Strategy
Always Principal-Level + Themed Weeks
Themed Weeks Examples
* Designing at Massive Scale
* Performance Bottlenecks & Capacity Planning
* Reliability & Incident Response
* Architecture Evolution & Tradeoffs
Each day explores a different angle of the theme.
No “easy days”.

8. Personalization Model (Lightweight)
Required (v1)
* Experience range
* Role (Backend, etc.)
Implicit Defaults
* Principal-level expectations
* Large-scale assumptions
* Production experience assumed
Optional (later)
* Domains
* Focus areas
No heavy onboarding.

9. Content Generation Strategy
Approach
Curated Roadmap + AI Expansion
* Human-defined:
    * Themes
    * Scenario types
    * Interview angles
* AI-generated:
    * Scenarios
    * Bad / Good / Best answers
    * Interviewer rubric
This avoids randomness and shallow output.

10. Delivery Architecture (Conceptual)
Core Flow
Scheduler → Generate content → Publish static page → Send link
Delivery Channels
* Email (v1)
* WhatsApp (v2)
WhatsApp is only a delivery pipe, never the content source.

12. Trust & Credibility Strategy
Senior engineers buy judgment, not features.

* Share “Bad vs Best answer” snippets publicly
* Opinionated takes on LinkedIn
No testimonials needed initially.

13. Go-to-Market Strategy (Focused)
Primary Channels
1. LinkedIn
    * Daily or weekly excerpts

2. Word of mouth
    * Peer sharing
3. Private communities
    * Senior engineer groups
Avoid
* SEO-heavy blogs
* Paid ads early
* Mass-market messaging

14. Legal & Safety
